# Complete Phase 1 Manually - Step by Step Guide

## What We've Already Done ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Changed network magic bytes (prevents Kaspa connection)
2. ‚úÖ Updated all ports (17xxx range)
3. ‚úÖ Removed Kaspa DNS seeds
4. ‚úÖ Updated network names (stokes-*)
5. ‚úÖ Set MaxSompi to 12.6B STKS
6. ‚úÖ Implemented Bitcoin-style halving

## What You Need to Do Now

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `stokes`
3. Description: `STOKES - Kaspa fork with Bitcoin-style halving emission`
4. Choose **Private** (recommended for now)
5. Do **NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

**Write down your GitHub username**: ___________________

### STEP 2: Update go.mod

```bash
cd /Users/sam/srv/playground/stokes

# Open go.mod in editor
nano go.mod

# Change line 1 from:
module github.com/kaspanet/kaspad

# To (replace YOUR_USERNAME):
module github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes

# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
```

### STEP 3: Update All Import Statements

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
find . -name "*.go" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|github.com/kaspanet/kaspad|github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes|g' {} +

# This updates all .go files at once
```

### STEP 4: Rename Binary Directories

```bash
cd /Users/sam/srv/playground/stokes/cmd

# Rename the directories
mv kaspactl stokesctl
mv kaspaminer stokesminer
mv kaspawallet stokeswallet

cd ..
```

### STEP 5: Update Git Remote

```bash
# Remove old remote (points to Kaspa)
git remote remove origin

# Add your new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

### STEP 6: Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Phase 1: Network isolation and rebranding complete

- Changed network magic bytes to prevent Kaspa conflicts
- Updated ports to 17xxx range
- Removed Kaspa DNS seeds
- Updated network names to stokes-*
- Set MaxSompi to 12.6B STKS
- Implemented Bitcoin-style halving
- Updated module name and imports
- Renamed binaries (kaspa* ‚Üí stokes*)"
```

### STEP 7: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to your new repository
git push -u origin master

# If that fails, try:
git push -u origin main

# You may need to authenticate with GitHub
```

### STEP 8: Test Compilation (If Go is Installed)

```bash
# Update dependencies
go mod tidy

# Try to build
go build ./...

# If successful, you'll see no output
# If errors, note them down - we'll fix them
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "go: module github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes: git ls-remote"

**Solution**: This is normal! Your imports reference your new repo, but Go can't find it yet because you just created it. This will resolve after you push.

### Error: "package github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes/... is not in GOROOT"

**Solution**: Run `go mod tidy` after pushing to GitHub. Go needs to download dependencies.

### Error: "fatal: remote origin already exists"

**Solution**: 
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes.git
```

### Error: "failed to push some refs"

**Solution**: Make sure you created the GitHub repository first, and it's empty (no README).

## Verification Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check go.mod has your username
head -1 go.mod
# Should show: module github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes

# 2. Check git remote
git remote -v
# Should show your GitHub repo

# 3. Check binary directories
ls cmd/
# Should show: genkeypair  stokesctl  stokesminer  stokeswallet

# 4. Check a sample import
grep "github.com" domain/consensus/factory.go | head -5
# Should show your GitHub username, not kaspanet

# 5. Check network names
grep "Name:" domain/dagconfig/params.go | head -4
# Should show stokes-mainnet, stokes-testnet, etc.
```

## What's Still Missing (Phase 2)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Genesis Block

**Current Status**: Still using Kaspa's genesis block

**Why Critical**: Your chain needs its own genesis to be truly independent

**What to Do**:
1. Don't launch publicly yet
2. Genesis generation is complex - needs separate tool
3. For now, you can test privately with existing genesis
4. Before mainnet launch, MUST generate new genesis

**Files to Update Later**:
- `domain/dagconfig/genesis.go`
- All network params (GenesisBlock, GenesisHash)

### üü° IMPORTANT - Additional Rebranding

**Remaining "kaspa" references**: ~1000+

**Critical ones**:
- Config directory paths (`~/.kaspad` ‚Üí `~/.stokesd`)
- Log messages
- Error messages
- User-facing strings

**Can wait**:
- Code comments
- Internal variable names
- Documentation

---

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# See current remote
git remote -v

# Check module name
head -1 go.mod

# Count remaining "kaspa" references
grep -r "kaspa" --include="*.go" . | wc -l

# Test build (if Go installed)
go build ./...

# Run tests (if Go installed)
go test ./...
```

## Next Steps After Phase 1

1. **Test Compilation**
   - Install Go if needed
   - Fix any compilation errors
   - Run unit tests

2. **Genesis Block**
   - Research genesis generation
   - Create generation tool
   - Generate new genesis for all networks

3. **Private Testing**
   - Deploy devnet
   - Mine test blocks
   - Verify emission schedule

4. **Complete Rebranding**
   - Update remaining "kaspa" references
   - Update documentation
   - Create new README

5. **Security Audit**
   - Review all changes
   - Test edge cases
   - Consider professional audit

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Check PHASE1_PROGRESS.md** - Detailed status
2. **Check error messages** - Usually self-explanatory
3. **Search GitHub Issues** - Others may have similar issues
4. **Ask in Discord/Community** - Crypto dev communities are helpful

---

## Important Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT launch publicly yet** - Genesis block issue must be resolved

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep repo private** - Until you're ready for public testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test thoroughly** - Use devnet/simnet for testing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backup everything** - Keep copies of important changes

‚úÖ **You're making progress** - Phase 1 is 50% done!
