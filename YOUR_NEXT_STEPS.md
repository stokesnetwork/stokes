# YOUR NEXT STEPS - Simple Action Plan

## 🎯 Where You Are Now

✅ **DONE**: Network isolation complete (magic bytes, ports, DNS)
✅ **DONE**: Emission schedule implemented (Bitcoin-style halving)
✅ **DONE**: Supply cap set (12.6 billion STKS)

📍 **YOU ARE HERE**: Ready to set up GitHub and complete Phase 1

---

## 🚀 Do These 5 Things Now

### 1. Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

**Go to**: https://github.com/new

**Fill in**:
- Repository name: `stokes`
- Description: `STOKES - Kaspa fork with Bitcoin-style halving emission`
- Visibility: **Private** (recommended)
- ❌ Do NOT check "Add a README file"
- ❌ Do NOT add .gitignore
- ❌ Do NOT choose a license

**Click**: "Create repository"

**Write down your username**: ___________________

---

### 2. Update Your Code (10 minutes)

Open terminal and run these commands **exactly as shown** (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
cd /Users/sam/srv/playground/stokes

# Update go.mod
sed -i '' 's|module github.com/kaspanet/kaspad|module github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes|g' go.mod

# Update all imports
find . -name "*.go" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's|github.com/kaspanet/kaspad|github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes|g' {} +

# Rename binary directories
cd cmd
mv kaspactl stokesctl 2>/dev/null || true
mv kaspaminer stokesminer 2>/dev/null || true
mv kaspawallet stokeswallet 2>/dev/null || true
cd ..

# Update git remote
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null || true
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes.git
```

**Verify it worked**:
```bash
# Should show YOUR username, not kaspanet
head -1 go.mod

# Should show YOUR repo
git remote -v
```

---

### 3. Commit and Push (5 minutes)

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Phase 1: Network isolation and rebranding

- Changed network magic bytes (STKS, TSTK, SSTK, DSTK)
- Updated ports to 17xxx range
- Removed Kaspa DNS seeds
- Updated network names to stokes-*
- Set MaxSompi to 12.6B STKS
- Implemented Bitcoin-style halving
- Updated module name and imports
- Renamed binaries to stokes*"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
# If that fails, try: git push -u origin main
```

**Check**: Go to https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stokes
You should see your code!

---

### 4. Test Compilation (Optional - if Go installed)

```bash
# Update dependencies
go mod tidy

# Try to build
go build ./...

# If successful: no output (good!)
# If errors: note them down, we'll fix later
```

**Don't have Go?** That's okay! Skip this step for now.

---

### 5. Read the Documentation

**Essential reading** (in order):
1. `PHASE1_WHAT_WE_DID.md` - What we accomplished
2. `PHASE1_PROGRESS.md` - Detailed status
3. `STOKES_EMISSION_CHANGES.md` - Technical details

**When you're ready for next phase**:
4. `EMISSION_SCHEDULE_EXAMPLE.md` - Verify emission
5. `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - How to test

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Completion Checklist

After completing steps 1-3 above, check these off:

- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] go.mod updated with your username
- [ ] All imports updated
- [ ] Binary directories renamed
- [ ] Git remote updated
- [ ] Changes committed
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository visible on GitHub

**All checked?** 🎉 **Phase 1 is 90% complete!**

---

## ⚠️ What's Still Missing

### Critical (Must Do Before Launch)

**Genesis Block** - MOST IMPORTANT
- Current: Using Kaspa's genesis
- Needed: Generate new STOKES genesis
- Why: Your chain must be independent
- When: Before any public launch
- How: Complex - may need help

### Important (Should Do Soon)

**Testing**
- Compile the code
- Run unit tests
- Deploy private testnet
- Verify emission works

**Rebranding**
- ~1000 "kaspa" references remain
- Most are cosmetic (comments, logs)
- Some are functional (config paths)
- Can be done gradually

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do Yet

❌ **Do NOT launch mainnet** - Genesis block not ready
❌ **Do NOT make repository public** - Not ready for scrutiny
❌ **Do NOT announce publicly** - Too early
❌ **Do NOT contact exchanges** - Way too early
❌ **Do NOT start marketing** - Product not ready

---

## 📅 Realistic Timeline

**Today**: Complete steps 1-3 above (20 minutes)

**This Week**: 
- Test compilation
- Fix any errors
- Research genesis generation

**Next Week**:
- Generate new genesis block
- Deploy private testnet
- Test emission schedule

**Month 1-2**:
- Complete testing
- Security review
- Documentation

**Month 3+**:
- Public testnet
- Community building
- Prepare for mainnet

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### "sed: command not found"
You're not on Mac/Linux. Use a text editor instead:
1. Open go.mod
2. Manually change line 1
3. Use find & replace in your editor for imports

### "Permission denied" when pushing to GitHub
You need to authenticate:
```bash
# Set up GitHub authentication
gh auth login
# Or use SSH keys
```

### "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
Your local and remote repos don't match:
```bash
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
# Then push again
```

### Compilation errors
Don't worry! This is normal. Common causes:
- Import paths not fully updated
- Missing dependencies
- Go version mismatch

**Solution**: Note the errors, we'll fix them together.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep a log** - Write down what you do
2. **Commit often** - Small commits are better
3. **Test in private** - Use devnet/simnet
4. **Ask for help** - Community is friendly
5. **Be patient** - This takes time
