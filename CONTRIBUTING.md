- **Testing:** How you tested it
- **Screenshots:** If UI changes

### Example PR Description

```markdown
## What
Implement Bitcoin-style halving verification tests

## Why
Need comprehensive tests to ensure halving logic works correctly across all eras

## How
- Added test cases for each halving era
- Verified reward calculation at boundaries
- Tested edge cases (64+ halvings)

## Testing
- All new tests pass
- Existing tests still pass
- Tested manually on testnet
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
go test ./...

# Specific package
go test ./domain/consensus/processes/coinbasemanager

# With coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Verbose output
go test -v ./...
```

### Writing Tests

- Test files end with `_test.go`
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases
- Keep tests focused and clear

### Example Test

```go
func TestHalvingCalculation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        block    uint64
        expected uint64
    }{
        {"era 0", 0, 50 * constants.SompiPerKaspa},
        {"era 1", 126230400, 25 * constants.SompiPerKaspa},
        {"era 2", 252460800, 12.5 * constants.SompiPerKaspa},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := calcHalvingBlockSubsidy(tt.block)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %d, want %d", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## üìö Code Style

### Go Guidelines

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write clear variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle errors explicitly

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** `lowercase_with_underscores.go`
- **Packages:** `lowercase` (single word)
- **Functions:** `CamelCase` (exported) or `camelCase` (internal)
- **Constants:** `CamelCase` or `UPPER_CASE`
- **Variables:** `camelCase`

### Comments

```go
// CalcBlockSubsidy calculates the block subsidy based on the current
// block DAA score, implementing Bitcoin-style halving every ~4 years.
//
// The subsidy starts at 50 STKS and halves every 126,230,400 blocks.
// After 64 halvings, the subsidy becomes 0.
func CalcBlockSubsidy(blockDaaScore uint64) uint64 {
    // Implementation...
}
```
